```

This code defines a set of ethical rules for decision-making in AI systems. The `define_ethical_rules()` function returns a list of rules, which are then retrieved and printed using the `get_ethical_rules()` and `print_ethical_rules()` functions, respectively. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to print the ethical rules.
